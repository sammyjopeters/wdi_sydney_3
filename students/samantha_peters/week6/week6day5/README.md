## Hangman LAB

###Goal:
* The goal of this lab is to practice organizing your JavaScript code in an object-oriented way and using the underscore.js library to manipulate arrays. It will also allow you to continue to practice working with events and manipulating the DOM.

### The Hangman Game:
* The game selects a random word from a word list and makes that the secret word
* The player guesses one letter at a time, trying to figure out what the word is
* If the player guesses correctly, any instances of that letter are revealed in the secret word
* If the player guesses incorrectly, they are penalized by taking away a guess
* If a player reveals all of the letters of the secret word, they win
* If a player makes 8 incorrect guesses before solving the secret word, they lose
