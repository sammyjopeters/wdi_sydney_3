Create a Rails app to model books

Models:

    An Author has a name, bio, image, etc.
    A Book has a title, description, genre, image, ISBN, etc

    Author has_many books

This should be a full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) app for both models.


On the author show page, include images of all their book titles (linked to their show pages)
On the book show page, include a picture of the author (which is linked to the author show page)

On any list page, render the colection with a partial.  Instead of a table - use divs.

eg for the main '/books' page, inside the div, put the title and author name, and show the book's image. Then make the whole div a clickable link to the book's show page

You can use lorem-pixel for book images if you like (or google for book images and use them) eg
http://lorempixel.com/100/120

Note: if you remove the edit/destroy buttons from the list pages - you must make them available from some other page (eg the show page)


Put a common header and footer on all the pages.
In the footer, put placeholders for the standard website pages: about_us, contact_us, privacy, Terms&Conds etc

In the header, put a logo and some code for showing any flash messages



create a navigator (either left or right side of the page) that will show a list of all the books (just names) as links to individual books
Make it show up for all pages

Update the controllers so that it doesn't explode if you can't find the book/author asked-for. Instead redirect back to the list-page and show an alert to the user that what they asked for doesn't exist and to try again.


Extra Credit:

Make the "redirect to list if not found" method work on *all* the actions
that fetch out a single instance eg the show/edit/update/destroy methods for
each controller

Update the navigator so that for all author pages, it shows a list of
authors instead of books

Update the header so that you can put the page-title (h1) beside the logo
instead of directly onto the page (hint: use @title)
Update the main layout to use an html title to also display the @title
