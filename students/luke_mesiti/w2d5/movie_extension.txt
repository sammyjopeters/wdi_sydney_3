So, the next project is going to be an extension of the movies project. 
We want you to store in a file a history of movies that you've looked at (not searches, actual movies).
You will need to show the list of movies  that have been clicked on... as a list of links so that you can click on them and see the whole page again.
Put an image next to each link in the history list.


Extra credit: cacheing the lot:
store all the data you get for the movie, so that if a person asks for a movie you've already got - just duisplay it from your cache instead
