So, the next project is going to be an extension of the movies project. 
We want you to store in a file a history of movies that you've looked at (not searches, actual movies).
You will need to show the list of movies  that have been clicked on... as a list of links so that you can click on them and see the whole page again.
Put an image next to each link in the history list.

Extra credit: cacheing the lot:
store all the data you get for the movie, so that if a person asks for a movie you've already got - just duisplay it from your cache instead

This is totally optional - you can prioriitise finishing up your past homework if you like - but if you get to the end of that (or if you think practicing the file stuff is going to be more useful to your skillset) then have a go at this one.
Also: don't forget to write a blogpost this weekend!
